## rust vs go
- both can be compiled to generate executables
- hello world go executable on windows is just more than 2mb while that for rust is just 145kb; rust also generates a pdb file for help in debugging
- go trades runtime speed/performance for developer convinience, performance is not as bad as python but not as good as c/cpp
- rust advantage over c/cpp is that compiled program is memory safe
- go is easier to write programs in with fast compile times
- if development speed and convinience, good execution speed is a priority, use go; if memory safety, execution speed, runtime correctness, hardware level code is priority, use rust.
